### This is my cybersecurity team project - PurpleShark 
Our team name is Purple Hats and my team members are Dante Falls, Andrew Sorrells, and Mingnon Pender.

INSTRUCTIONS -
1. In Linux, run PurpleShark from the command line: ./purpleShark.sh
- You may need to run with sudo command as the script will create new a folder and files.
2. PurpleShark will pop up a window greeting you and asking if you want to analyze a pcap file. Click "yes" on the pop-up screen.
3. PurpleShark will pop-up another window showing your file system in GUI. Choose the Pcap file you want to analyze in the GUI file system.
4. PurpleShark will start analyze the Pcap with a progress bar showing the current progress.
5. PupleShark will tell you it finished the Pcap scan and outputted the results in a directory called "Purple".
6. PurpleShark will display a directory tree of the "Purple" directory in the terminal.
7. Now you can browse the text files with network traffic insights in the "Purple" directory.
8. Thanks for using PurpleShark! We enjoyed coding on this Pcap analyzer.
